The Discvice

This library is used to generate a vice-grip like clip for clipping onto Discraft Ultrastar type discs

to use it you should open up the src/assem.scad file in openscad. Then you can customize from there

still working out what I'm supposed to say for legal-ese licensing and all that. but in lieu of more official stuff:
I (the original creator/designer/software-writer) allow for modification and redistribution under the condition that the following conditions are met.
- Anyone using this library or the models it generates should assume no warranties or guarantees are provided.
- Any modifications should attribute this library and me (Riley Tuttle, it's creator)
- No commercial permissions without request. If I'm not making money on this neither should you.
- mostly just "be excellent to each other" - Abraham Lincoln - Bill and Ted
